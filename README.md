# ðŸ¦Š Foxon

**A workout journal that turns discipline into devotion.**

It's about transforming training into a personal narrativeâ€”where every workout becomes a chapter, and progress manifests as an evolving Fox that mirrors growth.

## Why Foxon?

Most fitness apps drown in metrics. Foxon offers something different: a simple ritual of intention and effort recognition. Design workout, log sets, then seal each session with a brief reflection, see stats as an cohesive story. These small moments compound into a devotion score that measures not perfection, but follow-through.

## What's Next

Currently exploring richer character development and story-building mechanics. Fox evolves as lifter stay consistentâ€”becoming stronger, more vibrant, more alive.
